# Limitations

The pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.

# End Notes

In this project I have tried to a perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of front-end & back-end.

This entire journey of making the project was awesome. I learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence.
